COMMENTS:
* This code is provided as-is and may have several areas for improvement;
* The code is free to use, but we kindly request that you acknowledge the author if you use it in your personal work, 
  both in recognition of his efforts and ethical standards;
* The programming language used is MATLAB, and the program was developed under a student license (#41131103);
* The source code for the area of the Direct-Fusion Drive is not available, but the reader can introduce different
  geometrical setups and the code should adapt appropriately. Moreover, the original area data is present 
  within 'DFD_Area.txt'.
* The theoretical modelling and basis for this code can be found in the associated M.Sc. thesis:
  [To be announced].
